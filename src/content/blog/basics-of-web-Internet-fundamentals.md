## What's DNS ?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates easily memorizable domain names (like example.com) to the numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. DNS also specifies the structure of the domain names hierarchy and provides distributed, fault-tolerant, and reliable mechanisms for domain name resolution.
