I'm Kalana Kt, a passionate and driven frontend developer with a knack for creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications. My journey in the world of programming has led me to explore a wide range of technologies, from frontend frameworks like React and Svelte to backend solutions using Node.js and Spring Boot. I thrive on learning new languages and tools, constantly pushing myself to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

I have a diverse professional background, working with companies like NodeVision and Z Vender, where I've honed my skills in crafting visually stunning and technically robust web solutions. My expertise extends beyond coding; I also excel in client communication and project management, ensuring that every project not only meets but exceeds expectations.

In addition to my professional work, I run my own agency, [Netronk Innovation](www.netronk.com), where I offer freelance services and custom solutions tailored to my clients' needs.

When I'm not coding or working on client projects, you'll find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge through technical blog posts. My ultimate goal is to become a master of full-stack development, with a special focus on TypeScript and Rust.
